print((5 + 4) * 10 / 2)

print(((5 + 4) * 10) / 2)

print((5 + 4) * (10 / 2))

print(5 + (4 * 10) / 2)

print(5 + 4 * 10 // 2) # // this is is called floor division. it returns the result in integer but in flooring. lets say, 11//2 = 5.5 normally but it will show 5. it applys flooring to the result
